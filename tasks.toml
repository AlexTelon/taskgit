In case you dont want to update the text as you close it you could just remove it in a commit.

But in case you want to update the text before you remove then right now you would first commit the
change and then commit the removal..

Also history.py should be updated to reflect that if the task has been removed it should always be closed?
But what of other types of removal like removed, deleted?

I want to keep this simple yet flexible. So either make this configurable or make the code small and simple
so that others can modify the code.

Maybe not have a done/close column at all? We can ofc get it from history. But maybe it should only be visible in that view?
